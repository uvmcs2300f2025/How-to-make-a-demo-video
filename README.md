# How to make a demo video
A step-by-step guide to creating a demo video in MS Teams

Once you are finished your project and want to make a demo video, follow these steps:
1. Open MS Teams
1. Go to the Calendar tab (left side)
1. Click on "Meet now" (upper right)
1. The meeting defaults to the name "Meeting with <your name>" and you can choose to change it. Then click "Start meeting".
1. When the start screen appears, you can choose your camera and microphone settings. Then click "Join now".
1. Close out of the "Invite people to join you" popup.
1. Share your screen using the Share button (upper right). I recommend sharing the whole screen, as it will be necessary in later modules to show popup windows.
1. The Teams meeting window will minimize; click on it to maximize it again.
1. Click on the three dots "More" button in the upper menu, choose "Record and transcribe", and "Start recording"
1. It will confirm the language is English with a popup and will start recording.
1. Go to your program and do the demo runs:
    * Make sure you run your program multiple times and demonstrate the input validation by entering invalid and valid inputs. 
    * It is helpful but not necessary to record voiceover to describe your program.
    * It is helpful but not necessary to show your code and talk through your source files.
1. Once you are finished with the demo runs, exiting the meeting will stop the recording.
1. Wait a few minutes for the recording to save.
1. In MS Teams, go to the Chat tab (left side).
1. Your meeting should show up under Chats in the left-hand menu. Click on it.
1. Click on the "View recap" button. This produces a popup of your video.
1. Click "Watch in browser" (top right). This opens the video in a web browser on MS Sharepoint.
1. Click "Share" (upper right), then "Copy link".
1. **Click Settings and choose People in University of Vermont**. Under More settings, make sure it says "Can view". You have the option to set an expiration date.
1. Click "Apply".
1. Paste the link in the submission box.

Now you're good to go!
